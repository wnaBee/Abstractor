# abstractor [WIP]
An automatic commentor for code 
### use
`./filereader [file] [fileformat]`

##### (currently) supported formats:

|file format| command |
|-----------|---------|
| c++ | .cpp |

Disclaimer: version 1.0 is not complete and will result in messy comments, however it somewhat works, still needs fixing with some spaces, certain keywords, and double char operators.
